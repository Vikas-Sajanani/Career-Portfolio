# Personal Website and Portfolio

Hi! I am Vikas - a Fullstack developer! I code in Java/Node.js using tools like Spring Batch for major government clients, learn new skills, and challenge myself along the way. I am an Analyst at Accenture (a global tech consultancy) and work primarily with UK government on critical welfare projects. I am creating this website to have a digital presence; a place to add my creations and a hub for people to reach out if interested. 

## Code Honest
The design of this application is based on Brittany Chiang's original personal website [see here](https://brittanychiang.com/#about), so credit goes to her for the sleek look and unique features. The components in this repo are customized for an Accenture theme by a talented Front-end engineer in my professional circle Jan Bock [see here](https://www.jan-bock.dev/)
